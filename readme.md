# Quine-McCluskey Algorithm for Boolean Function Simplification

## Overview

This C++ program is designed to simplify boolean functions using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. It provides several key features, including:

- Conversion of boolean function to Canonical Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms.
- Generation of a truth table for the given boolean function.
- Construction of Karnaugh Maps (K-Maps) for visualization and simplification.
- Minimization of the boolean function using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.
- Identification of prime implicants and Essential Prime Implicants.
- Visualization of the logic circuit for the minimized function.

## Prerequisites

Before using this C++ program, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A C++ compiler and development environment (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio).
- Any required libraries or modules mentioned used.

## Usage

1. **Input**: The program takes a boolean function as input.

2. **Canonical Forms**:
   - The program prints the canonical forms.

3. **Truth Table**:
   - The program generates a truth table for the given boolean function.

4. **K-Map**:
   - The program creates Karnaugh Maps to visualize the function (4 variables max).

5. **Minimization**:
   - Utilize the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to minimize the boolean function. The minimized function will be displayed.

6. **Prime Implicants**:
   - The program will list the prime Implicants.

7. **Logic Circuit**:
   - Visualize the logic circuit for the minimized function. This can help in practical circuit design.
